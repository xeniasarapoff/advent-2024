# Advent of Code 2024 â€“ Solving Challenges with TypeScript

## **Introduction**

Welcome to my repository for **Advent of Code 2024**! ðŸŽ„ Each December, Advent of Code releases daily programming challenges leading up to Christmas. It's a fun way to improve problem-solving skills, explore new languages, and challenge yourself. 

This year, Iâ€™m tackling the challenges using **TypeScript**
